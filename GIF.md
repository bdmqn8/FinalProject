[Back to Home](README.md)

* An animated GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is essentially a digital flipbook of images cycling through a stack of images on a loop.

* The source code to add a GIF image would look like this:

          <img src="johnmayer.gif" alt="John Mayer pulling down his sunglasses">

* The output would look like this:   

<img src="johnmayer.gif" alt="John Mayer pulling down his sunglasses">

* The MIME Type for a GIF image is: image/gif
