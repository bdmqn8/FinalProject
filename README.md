## Adding Images to a Web Page
### Author: Bailey Murphy
### Purpose: To learn how to add various image types within a web page using HTML
### Target Audience: Anyone wanting to improve the design and appearance of their web page

* Images in HTML are defined with this __img__ tag. It is empty and contains only attributes. It does not have a closing tag. 

* The __src__ attribute specifies the URL (or web address) of the image.

* The __alt__ attribute provides alternate text for an image if the user cannot view the image. The value of the alt attribute should describe the image.

* There are three common file types of images implemented in web pages: JPEG/JPG, GIF, and PNG files.

JPEG/JPG

* The source code to add a JPEG/JPG image would look like this:

          <img src="pug.jpeg" alt="A pug sitting down">

* The output would look like this:
          
<img src="pug.jpeg" alt ="A pug sitting down">

* The MIME Type for a JPEG/JPG image is: image/jpeg

GIF

* The source code to add a GIF image would look like this:

          <img src="johnmayer.gif" alt="John Mayer pulling down his sunglasses">

* The output would look like this:   

<img src="johnmayer.gif" alt="John Mayer pulling down his sunglasses">

* The MIME Type for a GIF image is: image/gif

PNG

* The source code to add a PNG image would look like this:

          <img src="pug.png" alt="Pug">
          
* The output would look like this:

* The MIME Type for a PNG image is: image/png
